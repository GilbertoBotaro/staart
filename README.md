# Staart - get your project started

Staart is a library of components to get a node platform with user accounts quickly started.

## Boilerplate and live example

You can find a minimal boilerplate to get started here: [examples/staart](examples/staart).

Check out a live example here: [staart.nmr.io](http://staart.nmr.io). Featuring:

* Registration with email and password
* Login with email or username and password
* Account page where you can set your username, change your password, and resend a verification email
* Forgot password/reset password pages
* Verify email page

Note:

* This example site won't generate and send any emails
* Facebook and Google Logins are still TODO, and on the way

## Ooth

Staart's sister project is [Ooth](https://github.com/nmaro/ooth), a user accounts library for node (that you can use independently of staart).
