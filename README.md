# Staart - get your project started

Staart is a library of components to get a node platform with user accounts quickly started.

Staart's sister project is [Ooth](https://github.com/nmaro/ooth), a user accounts library for node (that you can use independently of staart).

You can find a minimal boilerplate to get started here: [examples/staart](examples/staart)
